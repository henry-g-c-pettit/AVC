Objectives up to week 3:

End of week one
Charlotte -Helping with any of the coding if it is too much and keeping note of milestones in the code.
Jolon - sorting out the colour camera and working out how to detect a straight line of tape
Henry - thinking of changes to RPI and working on moving forward method
Sopana - Developing prototype chassis / forward movement code 
Cayden-
Should we just have everyone working on the movement to the RPI and Henry and Sopana working on changes to RPI
- AVC plan done, camera and motors working. Prototype chassis 
We should start of the RPI moving forward with basic stuff (no modifications made yet)

End of week 2
Charlotte - Keep track of all code attempts and have in doc ready for mid term report.
Jolon - getting IR camera detecting walls and working on detecting turns in the tape
Henry - working on turning method and starting work on the RPI mods
Sopana - Start on mods/ finalise design .
Cayden-
Maybe people working on the turning method (like the amount it should turn) and camera method and front sensor for the gate. Sopana and Henry working on the mods.
-We should start on the cameras detecting the line and thinking of a method to open the gate. Mods being made to the RPI now

End of week 3:
Charlotte - Have an almost finalised all code for mid term report
Jolon - Finishing detecting the tape and combining everyone's finished code
Henry - working on turning method on tape maze and finishing up RPI mods
Sopana - Start building chassis / help with quadrant 3 code 
Cayden-

Everyone working on the turning with given camera input and tape maza navigation. Sopana and Henry working on the mod required for the RPI and ordering the parts.
-We should have the RPI moving on the curved line and getting up to the mazed tape bit. Mods to the RPI should be almost complete and all extra components to RPI be ready to get.

Week4: Progress report Due/ quad 4 done 
Week5: Robot Due 
19th June: Final Report Due

Conflicts:
Charlotte - Have casual work so will have limited time and will only know one week in advance.
Jolon - Lives in upper hutt and needs to leave when uni finishes. So can’t work together after uni.

Team agreement:
By signing below, all team members are acknowledging that they have read and committed to their part in the AVC. They acknowledge that they will attempt to complete the tasks agreed on by the group each week and document this on the team github account. They acknowledge that failure to meet these goals
can result in the team recommending any member receives a lesser grade for their AVC report. In the event that a team member is unable to complete their task due to circumstances beyond their control (i.e. sickness, bereavement etc) that they will inform the team at the earliest possible time. Finally, the team acknowledges that a member going a week without contact with other team members (except when discussed with the team in advance) will constitute the member in question being considered AWOL. In this instance the team agrees to inform the ENGR101 course co-ordinator immediately. The penalty this for this can range from a reduction in the nal grade to immediate failure of the AVC (and thus the ENGR101 course). Should the team unanimously agree that a member (or members) have failed to contribute to the AVC suciently for other reasons, on the day of robot testing the team will be given the opportunity to anonymously vote for a team member to receive 0% for the robot part of the
AVC. Should the team choose this option they MUST be able to show that the member in question had been assigned tasks that they failed to complete and that the team had a orded them an opportunity to make up for past mistakes.
